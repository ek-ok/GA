- It is good that Julie included her motivation and goal of her analysis at the beginning. 
- She imported data well, column names are good, conversion is good
- Her dataframe merge process is clear
- Correlation matrix is a good start. But I am curious why she removed “All beverages”
- It is interesting that liver cancer rate has a positive relationship with wine consumption but a negative relationship with Beer.
- It might be good idea to think of why this is the case
- Good seaborn charts from cell [653] - [111]
- I think beer analysis part is interesting. Especially results are different depending on the states. 
- To answer this question, I would take a closer look into data. 
	1. For example, are  there enough samples for each state or alcohol type?
	2. How were the alcohol data collected? Liquor store or bar sales?
	3. How were the cancer data collected? 
	4. Cancer by state indicates where patients live or where their hospitals are located?
- “It's not about whether you drink beer, spirits or wine, it's about the amount of ethanol that's present in the drink” I think this is a good point.
- Another think she should consider to convince her friend not to drink too much in order to prevent from getting cancers is correlation vs causation. 
- Baybe people go to bar and consume alcohol smoke cigarettes. That might be the causation of cancers? If that is the case, not drinking too much does not prevent cancers. 
- It might be good idea to explore other data. For example, how people consume alcohol (bars vs at home) or does alcohol cause anything else other than cancer?
- Over all she did a good job visualizing data sets with many plots!
