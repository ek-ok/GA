- It might be a good idea to indicate objective of the analysis and data source at the top.
- I like “Calls per Agency” chart. It is a good start.
- It would be nice to put the legend outside of charts.
- Time series charts are nice.
- Cell [15] “So this shows that there are more calls during the winter especially from the housing department. This is because people call to complain about lack of heat.” This is interesting and it is good that he thought about causality.
- Cell [17] “This doesn't necessarily show any trends except for slight spikes on the 8th, 18th and 24th of the month, especially with the housing department. Calls are almost half for the 31st which makes sense because only 7 out of the 12 months have 31 days. - “ This is another part which shows that he is very critical of the result and identified the causality.
- Cell[19] - [43] I like his top down approach.
- My favorite plot is the geography map plots. They came out very nicely and visually informative!
- Good job!
