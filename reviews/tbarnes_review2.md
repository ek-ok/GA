- His objective is clear and that helps us to review his project.
- It would have been nice, if he included data source and brief description of each column
- He spend a lot of effort to clean up his data before analysis
- Cell 27, plot came out very nicely and the max_depth seems reasonable
- Cell 28, roc curve looks good
- Cell 40, R^2 is not as high as he wanted.
- Maybe simplify the problem to forecast? For example, turn this into a binary classification problem (win vs loose) based on the halftime game situation
