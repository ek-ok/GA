It is good that Theodore included “contents” at the top. It makes easier for reader to understand what I am about to see. I will write feedback based on his contents.

1. Overview of Data Collection
Well done, he is very clear about the data source, how the data looks like
He used data sets for 2011 and 2012. Why not 2013 and 2014? They are not available yet?

2. Importing and Cleaning Data
Did not know we can do, "bbl st_no st_name borough zip bench_sub entry_no ".split() very cool!
His clean up process is good

3. Deriving Features and Subgroups
Utilizing various techniques we learned from class such as lambda

4. Effects of Normalizing Variables
I like his boxplot. Very interesting.
It might be interesting to analyze why universities have the highest EUI range 

5. EUI by Property Type
good

6. ENERGY STAR Score
It is good that he started with his hypothesis
Nice scatter plot supports his theory
He explained why he thinks miltifamily plot looks a nice S shape. good

7. Water Usage
This chart came out nice. Also showing side by side was a nice idea too.
It might be good to explore more about two big green circles. 

8. Next Steps 
I am interested to see what he can predict using machine learning. 
It seems like Energy Star rating can be predicted using EDI. Anything else?
