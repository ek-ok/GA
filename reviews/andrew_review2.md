- His objective and explanation of datasets are clear and that helps us to review his project.
- cell 110, he balanced data sets before ML analysis
- He explained his features well. Very helpful
- Cell 121, initial accuracy was 71%, which is good
- It is good that he tried different methods to optimize his tree model
- Perhaps he can try another classifier too?
- Overall his analysis is clear and hyperparameter tuning process was great
- Good job!
