- His objective and explanation of datasets are clear and that helps us to review his project.
- Cell 6, this is interesting, title, xlabel, ylabel would be helpful
- Using join, merge efficiently
- Cell 21, the final result came out nicely and it makes sense to include different types to facilities
- cell 26, 27, I like the way he separated features, easy to follow 
- cell 85 these plots look nice
- Good job!
