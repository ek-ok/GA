1 Clustering

2 Useful for exploring data and finding natural groupings. Members of a cluster are more like each other than they are like members of a different cluster. Common examples include finding new customer segments, and life sciences discovery.

3 Clustering analysis finds clusters of data objects that are similar in some sense to one another. 

	Density-based — This type of clustering finds the underlying distribution of the data and estimates how areas of high density in the data correspond to peaks in the distribution. High-density areas are interpreted as clusters. Density-based cluster estimation is probabilistic.

	Distance-based — This type of clustering uses a distance metric to determine similarity between data objects. The distance metric measures the distance between actual cases in the cluster and the prototypical case for the cluster. The prototypical case is known as the centroid.

	Grid-based — This type of clustering divides the input space into hyper-rectangular cells and identifies adjacent high-density cells to form clusters.
